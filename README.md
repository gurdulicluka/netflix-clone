# IMPORTANT

Live deployment will trigger google security and deem the website "unsafe" or "dangerous" aka phishing website. But that is only because it has test mode payment system and email authentication while not being fully setup for production.

Proceed further without any concerns, its just a dummy project and I can't in no shape or form see your data, except your email that you use to sign up.

Press "Details" and "then visit this unsafe site" at the end of the message.
